Quick summary : 

The understanding of ocean circulation is a key issue in climate science. A better understanding of ocean currents allows us to improve weather predictions, decode surface biological phenomena, detect eddies, optimize ship trajectories, etc. 
\par
Thanks to satellites, and especially in the context of the future launch of the SWOT mission, it is necessary to be able to analyze the various data collected. Recent advances in neural networks make these algorithms perfect tools for extracting relevant information from a large amount of data.
\par 
In order to predict the Sea Surface Height, the Surface Temperature as a marker of advection is an indispensable feature.
\par 
Using a neural architecture adapted to image processing U-net, it was shown the relevance and interest of using the Surface Temperature to predict the evolution of the Surface Height.
